Day 17

While roaming the forests of
Hell Creek, I discovered the 
most peculiar animal. Upon 
further inspection, I have
concluded that the beast is
none other than an Ankylosaurus.

Covered in armor, and
equipped with it's large 
club tail, I believe that
the Ankylosaurus is quite
capable of standing it's own
in a fight against even the
mighty Tyrannosaurus. 
When I tried to get close
to investigate a lone
Ankylosaurus, it prepared 
to attack, unlike most
other herbivores I've seen.

Day 21

I've discovered that these 
magnificent animals love
clubmoss! Upon feeding two
Ankylosaurus this, they began
to mate, and laid several
eggs nearby.

Day 23

I stumbled upon a dead
Ankylosaurus yesterday, and an
idea struck me. Would it's armor 
protect me as well as it does them?
 I set to work, and 
created a wonderfully protective
chest plate and helmet!
