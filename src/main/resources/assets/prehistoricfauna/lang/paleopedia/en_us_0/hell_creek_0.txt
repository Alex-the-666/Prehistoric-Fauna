Day 4:

I discovered the gateway. Upon 
crossing through, I found a world 
that is very different. This place
is lush, with plants that have 
been extinct for millions of years.
Moss carpets the ground, and 
large animals roam the land. At the 
moment, I am unable to confirm 
where I am, but I believe this may 
be Hell Creek, a late Cretaceous 
formation. I shall do my best to
document everything I discover 
here.
